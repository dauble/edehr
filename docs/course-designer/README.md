# A course designer's role

> Course designers create and manage the case studies that are relevant to their curriculum. They create assignments based in the simulated EHR using a case study they created or got from another educator.  

## Prerequisites
- Your LMS administrator has created the external connection tool for the EdEHR.

## Creating your first EdEHR activity.

> The following is for Moodle yet the steps are similar in other LMS

Just a suggestion.  For your very first activity, with the EdEHR, create an activity that only requires your students to explore a case study and report on their findings.  And start with one of the case studies that all instances of EdEHR provides. For example [the Erin John's case](https://edehr.org/ehr/patient/demographics?demoOnlyKey=erin2Seed)

1. In moodle, navigate to your course. Select the gear icon and select "Turn editing on".
![1]

2. Click on "Add activity or resource"
![2]

3. Select "External tool" from the list
![3]

4. Configure the activity using the EdEHR external tool.
   1. Enter an **Activity name**. This name will be the link text the student will click on, It will also be the activity name that appears in the EdEHR.
   2. Select the preconfigured tool your LMS admin created, for the EdEHR.
   3. For your students, click the "show more" link and add a description about this activity.

5. Before any student uses your new activity be sure you, as an instructor, click on the link.   You need to tell the EdEHR what content you want it to use for this activity. Until you make this connection students will not be able to do their work.
   1. Click on your new activity link.
   2. This will take you into the EdEHR and you will be taken to the "Unlinked Activity" page. If you are following our suggestion then just select the first item in the list.
      ![6]
   3. When you click the connect button you will see a warning. Just click through.  
   5. Next you, as an instructor, will be shown the instructor's 'activity' page. Everytime you, as an instructor, click your new LMS activity link you will see this page. This is where you will work with your class list and access the learning object you selected above. You can also access the 'Instructor Tools' (see [instructor tools](/instructor-tools/)). You now have your first activity ready for your students.
