# Instructor tools - Components of the EdEHR

The menu in the top right banner provides the instructor user with access to EdEHR pages and settings.  One of the most important items in this menu is the one that lets you, as an instructor, self elevate your role to be a content creator.  When you are a content creator you will see many more actions, and you will be able to both create and manage both Learning Objects and Case Studies.

## Courses

The Courses page lists all the courses you have accessed via a link in your LMS. Each instructor sees only the courses they have accessed via the LMS.  Under each Course is a list of Activities for that course. 

## Activity

The Activity page presents the information that came from the LMS; the activity link text and description. This page is where you can access the class list and the learning object.

## Learning Objects

Learning Objects presents a case study and one or more learning objectives.  Learning Objects can be reused by many Activities, especially across semesters.   

## Case Studies

A Case Study is the electronic chart data that represents a point in time during a simulated patient stay in a hospital. 

## Files

This page allows content creators to store files to be used in case studies. For example, x-rays, MRI scans, lab reports, etc.

## LMS

This page provides information about your LMS as seen by the EdEHR.

## Exit to LMS

This menu item takes you, the user, back to your LMS.

## Course designer mode

Instructors can self promote their role to "content creator".  With this role, users can create and manage Learning Objects and Case Studies.

## Hide button labels

This menu item toggles the display of labels in the buttons. With text hidden the display is more compact and most useful on smaller displays.
