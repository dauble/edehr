# Instructors and the class list

## Workflow

When a student first clicks on the activity link, in their LMS, they will see the linked base case study in the EHR. At this moment the student is added to the EdEHR Activity's class list.  The student can work in the EHR, leave and return via the link in the LMS, and eventually "submit" their work.  Once their work is marked as "submitted" the student can no longer modify their EHR work. 

Any instructor who has access to the LMS activity can also click the LMS activity link. The first time they do this the EdEHR will add them to the list of instructors who can see the Activity's class list.  

Instructors can "un-submit" or "unlock" any student's work so that the student can redo or resume their work in the EHR. And instructors can unlock or lock the entire class list.

## Evaluating assignments

Only when a student's work is "submitted" / "locked"  can an instructors review and comment on the student's work. 

A student's work can be evaluated by selecting either of the ![2] buttons. The 'Evaluate' button will show the student's work in the condensed view, without any base case data. The 'Eval in EHR' button will show the student's work in the EHR with base case data. There will be a green dot on the left side navigation panel for each page that has student data.

A persistent evaluation panel is located at the top of the page. It has a notes section plus the ability to save edits to the notes, progress forward or backward in the class list, select to view the student's work in the EHR or condensed view. 

## Importing evaluation notes into the LMS

> This process is awkward yet doable on a small scale. Ideally, EdEHR will someday be LTI 1.3 compliant and will be able to push evaluation information into the LMS without the following workaround.


From the Activity page select the link to the class list. Then select ![1] to download a CSV file, named after the Activity, containing the class list with evaluation notes. This file includes: givenName, familyName, lms_user_id, feedback: *Activity name*

Check you LMS manual for instructions on importing this CSV file into the grade book.
