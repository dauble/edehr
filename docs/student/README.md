# Student users of the EdEHR

> Many student users have reported that working in the EdEHR is intuitive and relatively easy

## Getting Started

All access to the EdEHR is through your school's learning management system (LMS). You start by logging into your LMS and navigate to your course. You will see many activities to complete and some of these may launch the EdEHR with a case study for you to work with.

## Student tools

Near the top right side you will see a Student tools menu.

### Activity information

Select Activity Information from the Student tools to see details about the current activity.

**Instructor comments**. If your instructor has reviewed your work they may have left some comments. This is where you can see them.

> This is an awkward part of the EdEHR UI because it is not easy for a student to find these comments. Perhaps someday the EdEHR will provide a page for students to review all their past activities and this page could show the instructor's comments.

**Course** This is the name of the course from your LMS.

**Activity** This is the activity name that you see in your LMS.  If the LMS provided a description then this appears here too.

**Learning Object**.  This is the information entered into the EdEHR about the Learning Object.  This area shows the name and description. The description often contains the learning objectives for this activity.


### Scratch pad

You have a private scratch pad for taking notes as you work. The text you see here is visible only to you and is for this current activity.

### Exit to LMS

This is a link that takes you back to your LMS.  (It uses a URL that your LMS gave to the EdEHR when you clicked the link in your LMS.)

## Top banner bar

The top banner includes the EHR page name, simulation time, submit button or status and the student tools menu.

It also has the EHR important information section. You can expand this section to see more.

> This EHR information banner will someday show diagnosis and allergies. 


## Submit

When you have completed the work assigned to you then press the 'Submit' button. This will allow your instructor to view and evaluate your work.  When your work is "submitted" then you can no longer make changes to the EHR content.

Your instructor may also close off the activity for any further work for you or for the whole class.
